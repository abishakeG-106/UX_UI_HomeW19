                <h1>Abishake Gnanaguruparan</h1>
                <p>Hello, I am Abishake Gnanaguruparan, an aspiring UX/UI designer based in Toronto, Ontario. I possess a background in Mechanical Engineering and love designing in my spare time. 
                I have been working in the design field for more than 6 years now; back when I first started my Undergraduate studies in Bachelors of Engineering (Hons.) at Ontario Tech University and then later specialized a major in Mechanical Engineering.  
                After completing my Bachelors Degree, I wanted to gain more skills in design and open up the opportunity to study coding and eventually web development. I enrolled myself into a UX/UI Bootcamp, where I have acquired fascinating skills and experience to enhance my role in the field of design. Not just in the mechanical sense, but I learned how to adapt quickly into the transition to this new career path. 
                I work quite well in a team friendly environment, while at the same time well rounded to work independently on my own in many of tasks/projects.
                To learn more about my credentials, please check out my resume.</p>
